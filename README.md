## Installing Yarn

Before you start using Yarn, you'll first need to install it on your system. There are many different ways to install Yarn, but a single one is recommended and cross-platform.

### Install via npm

It is recommended to install Yarn on your system through the [npm package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/), which comes bundled with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) when you install it on your system.

Once you have npm installed you can run the following both to **install** and **upgrade** Yarn.

    npm install --global yarn

### Alternative Installation Options

#### MacOS

Yarn install via Homebrew

You can install Yarn through the Homebrew package manager. This will also install Node.js if it is not already installed.

    brew install yarn

#### Upgrade Yarn via Homebrew

Yarn will warn you if a new version is available. To upgrade Yarn, you can do so with Homebrew.

    brew upgrade Yarn

#### Windows

Yarn install via installer.

This will give you a `.msi` file that when run will walk you through installing Yarn on Windows.

If you use the installer you will first need to install Node.js.

#### Windows Notice

Please whitelist your project folder and the Yarn cache directory `(%LocalAppData%\Yarn)` in your antivirus software, otherwise installing packages will be significantly slower as every single file will be scanned as itâ€™s written to disk.

### Check installation

Check that Yarn is installed by running the following command

    yarn --version
